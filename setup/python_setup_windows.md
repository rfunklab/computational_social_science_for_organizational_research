### Introduction
To begin working on our computational social science projects, we need to ensure that everyone has the right tools and environments set up on their computers. This guide is designed for Windows users and will walk you through installing Miniconda (a minimal installer for Conda) and setting up your project environment using an environment file. Let’s get started!

### Step 1: Download Miniconda for Windows
Miniconda is a minimal version of Conda, which is a package manager and environment manager. It includes only Conda, Python, and a few other necessary packages.

1. **Visit the Miniconda Download Page:** Go to [Miniconda's website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and find the Miniconda installer for Windows.
2. **Download the Appropriate Installer:** If you're unsure whether your Windows is 32-bit or 64-bit, you can check by going to `Settings` > `System` > `About` and looking under `System type`.
   - For 64-bit Windows, download the 64-bit installer.
   - For 32-bit Windows, download the 32-bit installer.

### Step 2: Install Miniconda on Windows
1. **Run the Installer:** Open the downloaded installer and follow the prompts. It's usually best to accept the default installation settings.
2. **Add Conda to Your PATH (Optional):** The installer will ask if you want to add Conda to your PATH environment variable. While it's recommended to let Conda manage its path, you may choose to add it if you're familiar with managing PATH variables.
3. **Complete the Installation:** Proceed with the installation by following the on-screen instructions.

### Step 3: Install Mamba
Mamba is a fast and flexible alternative to Conda for managing packages and environments, which we will use for creating our class environment.

1. **Open the Anaconda Prompt:** Search for the Anaconda Prompt in your Windows search bar and open it. It's important to use the Anaconda Prompt rather than the regular command prompt to ensure that your Conda commands work correctly.
2. **Install Mamba:** In the Anaconda Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
   ```

### Step 4: Create and Activate Your Conda Environment
You'll use a provided environment file to create a Conda environment. This file specifies all the packages and their versions needed for our class.

1. **Locate the Environment File:** Your instructor will provide you with an `environment_envpycss.yml` file. Save this file to a known location on your computer.
2. **Open the Anaconda Prompt:** If it's not already open, search for and open the Anaconda Prompt from your Windows search bar.
3. **Navigate to the File’s Directory:** Use the `cd` command to change your directory to where you've placed the `environment_envpycss.yml` file. Replace `PATH_TO_ENVIRONMENT_FILE` with the actual path where the file is located.
   ```
   cd PATH_TO_ENVIRONMENT_FILE
   ```
4. **Create the Environment:** Execute the following command to create your Conda environment from the `environment_envpycss.yml` file.
   ```
   mamba env create -f environment_envpycss.yml
   ```
5. **Activate the Environment:** To start using this environment, activate it by typing:
   ```
   conda activate envpyc
   ```

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues during the installation process, ensure that you are using the Anaconda Prompt for Windows commands.
- For issues related to environment creation or activation, verify the path to the `environment_envpycss.yml` file is correct and that you're in the correct directory.
